# Masking
This is a masking experiment that essentially deals with creating a mask over the characters in 
natural scenes. The data is generated synthetically and ground truth is developed using Otsu 
binarization. Different architectures are tried by varying depths etc. 
TODO: The final heatmap is need to be formed. This map is essentially a saliency map that gives 
a map over any image correspodingly masking background from images.
